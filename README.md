### Mods to implement
- Perfect invincibility (no drowning, no Black Screen of Death, unflip instead of getting wrecked, be able to get out of a flipped car, and never take too much damage)
- Unlimited upward velocity (skip web effect)
- Unlimited angular velocity
- Explosive cop cars when wrecked
- 2-player freeroam
- 2-player co-op undercover
- 2-player on-foot action
- Everything unlocked (towns, missions, cars, cheats, race tracks, debug menu, doors, gates, garages, switches, everything!)
- 2-player gamemodes (assisted or versus of quick chase, quick getaway, survival, etc.)
- Shift Existance (similar to Driver San Francisco; possibly with a floaty camera vision)
- Better Film Director for multiplayer (in multiplayer pause/gameover menu, no camera boundary/distance restrictions, better control, show/hide HUD, change Sfx/Music volume)
- and more...

### How is it done?
- All information (variables, types and function names) have been obtained from debugging symbols (.SYM), driver_psx_level and DLE
- Ghidra project (based on Italian SYM) to deal with overlays, simple code complex branching - semi-auto decompilation
- IDB based on Spanish SYM when dealing with things Ghidra can't handle properly - manual decompilation (mostly GTE code)

### How to use
The instructions are located on the original [REDRIVER2 repository's wiki](https://github.com/OpenDriver2/REDRIVER2/wiki/Installation-instructions)
